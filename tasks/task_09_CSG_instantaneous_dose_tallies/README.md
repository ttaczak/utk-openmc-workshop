## Task 9 - Dose

Please allow 20 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/neutronics_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/10).

In this task you will use OpenMC to calculate the dose administered to cells and materials in a geometry.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Appreciation of equivalent and effective dose.
- Dose tallies.
- Post-processing of tally results to obtain dose rate.
- Several geometry surfaces can be utilised to obtain a tally result as a function of a physical parameter, such as distance from source.
