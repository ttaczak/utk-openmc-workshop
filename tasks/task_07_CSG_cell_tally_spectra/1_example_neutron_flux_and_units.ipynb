    "\n",
    "Neutronics codes typically make use of cm instead of the SI base unit for length of meters, this is partly historical and partly due to the format of nuclear data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "A flux score on a cell in OpenMC therefore returns the average length that neutrons travel through the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have simulated many neutrons we can get an average result and as we have batches we can get a standard deviation on that result.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMC returns a flux tally in units of \"neutron cm per source neutron\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert this into more common units of flux \"neutrons per cm2 per second\" we must first divide by the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a cell tally we divide by the cell volume, if this was a mesh tally we would divide by the voxel volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us units of \"neutrons per cm2 per source neutron\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fixed source simulation (not an fission eigenvalue simulation) we can then scale the result by the number of neutrons per second that the source emits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the number of neutrons you would typically know the power of the fusion reactor in watts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming we are using DT fuel then we know that each neutron resulted in 17.6MeV or 2.8e-18Joules of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the neutrons per second is power in watts / 2.8e-18. For a 500MW fusion power reactor we would get 500e6/2.8e-18=1.785e+26 neutrons per second\n",
