## Task 5 - TBR

Please allow 10 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/neutronics_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/6).

In this task you will use OpenMC to run simple neutronics simulations to tally TBR using a cell tally.

**Learning Outcomes**

- OpenMC can be used to run simple neutronics simulations and tally TBR.
- Simple methods of increasing the TBR using Lithium enrichment.
