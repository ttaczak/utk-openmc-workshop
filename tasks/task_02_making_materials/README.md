## Task 2 - Materials

Please allow 20 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are in the [presentation](https://slides.com/neutronics_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/3).

In this task you will use OpenMC and the neutronics material maker to create a variety of neutronics-ready materials.

### Learning Outcomes

- Materials can be made in OpenMC using isotope and element fractions, and densities.
- The neutronics material maker provides an easy way to make materials and account for isotopic enrichment, temperature and pressure effects.
- Material density varies as a function of pressure, temperature, enrichment and mixture fraction.
- Mixed materials can be created using in-built OpenMC features or the neutronics material maker.
