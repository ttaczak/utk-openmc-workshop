## Task 8 - Mesh tallies

Please allow 15 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/neutronics_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/9)

In this task you will use OpenMC to tally interactions in a geometry using 2D and 3D mesh tallies.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Mesh tallies can be used in neutronics simulations to measure a variety of different reactions such as neutron absorption, tritium production and flux.
- How neutrons are dissipated around the reactor.
