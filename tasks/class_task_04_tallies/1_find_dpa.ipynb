    "# Simulating Displacements Per Atom (DPA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Displacements per atom (DPA) is one measure of damage within materials exposed to neutron irradiation. Damage energy can be tallied in OpenMC with MT reaction number 444 and DPA can be estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of DPA a neutronics code alone can't fully calculate the value as material science techniques are needed to account for the material and recombination effects. For example, after a displacement there is a chance that the atom relocates to it's original lattice position (recombination) and different atoms require different amounts of energy to [displace](https://fispact.ukaea.uk/wiki/Output_interpretation#DPA_and_KERMA). The DPA tally from neutronics is therefore only an estimate of the DPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MT 444 / damage energy tally is in units of eV per source particle. Therefore the result needs scaling by the source intensity (in neutrons per second), the irradiation duration (in seconds) and the number of atoms in the volume."
