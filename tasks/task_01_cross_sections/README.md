## Task 1 - Cross sections

Please allow 30 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/neutronics_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/2).

In this task you will be using OpenMC to plot interaction cross sections for isotopes, elements and materials. You will also see how Doppler broadening affects neutron interaction cross sections.


**Learning Outcomes**

- OpenMC can be used to plot interaction cross sections for specific isotopes, elements and materials.
- Reaction probabilities vary depending on the energy of the neutron.
- Beryllium 9 has the lowest threshold energy for neutron multiplication reactions.
- Lithium 6 has the highest probability of producing tritium at low neutron energies.
- Lithium-6 enrichment increases tritium production from low energy neutrons.
- The relative motion of colliding nuclei causes Doppler broadening of resonance peaks in interaction cross sections.
