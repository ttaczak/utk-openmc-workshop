## Task 14 - Activation and Transmutation

Please allow 20 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/neutronics_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/15).

In this task you will be using OpenMC to simulate transmutations within a material under neutron irradiation.


**Learning Outcomes**

- OpenMC can be used to track the build up and decay of activation products.
- The build up of unstable activated product starts to saturate at around five halflives, at this point the rate of creation of new activation products approaches the rate of decay.
- OpenMC can track the impact of material evolution on a tally. A material under irradiation transmutations and changes over time. This impacts the movement of neutron through the material which in turn influences tha tally result. Tritium Breeding Ratio tallies tend to decrease as the lithium 6 is burnt-up.
